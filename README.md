# Rainy Day Insurance
Rainy day insurance is an application that allows you to create and review car acciedent cases. Along side with personal information you can add a location by using the Google Maps API and upload photos to Google Firebase Storage. I have made this small portfolio app just to showcase my experience with creating front end applications with Unity. 


## Stack:
* Unity
* C#
* Firebase Storage
* Google Maps


## Architecture
* MVC (Model-View-Controller)
* Singleton pattern
* Use of C# events and delegates
* Interfaces

## UI
* I like to organise the UI into seperate panels. 
* Each panel has its own view component and its controller
* The UI was designed by me... I tried my best but I bet UX designers would have some suggestions :)
* Responsive design and safe area
* Tweening animations were made with LeanTween https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595
